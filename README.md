Smart-Infinity-Mirror
=====================

Smart Infinity Mirror that would have a clock, proximity sensor and a smart display
Ever since my addressable RGB LED strips (WS2812B) came from Aliexpress, I've been fascinated with LED projects. Following up on my success with my ​Charlieplexed LED clock, I wanted to create something with more Jazz..
While browsing google images, I came across an instructable for an ​Arduino Infinity Mirror and the brain cells started working in overdrive. Why shouldn't I make an infinity mirror, that's also a clock !!
